# North East Portal

In the north eastern region there is a distinct lack of proper and accurate information regarding activities of various ministries/departments accessible to the public. As a result, the general population canâ€™t hold the departments/ministries responsible. The solution that we propose to alleviate this  lack of transparency is to create an online portal that showcases the ongoing projects, their status, budget sanctions and all relevant information in an attractively designed and user-friendly website. This will help MoDoNer monitor and keep track of all ongoing projects and get feedback from the people of the North East. This will be a step in the right direction for the development and progress of the North Eastern region.
Along with the portal we have created an NLP API that will apply sentimental analysis to the comments posted by the public users and generate a report that will be sent to the ministry.
